Hi, My name is Jay Chakalasiya. I'm from India and currently located in Seattle, USA.     
  
I'm **_Science_** enthusiast by nature and **_Entrepreneur_** by nurture. By profession, I'm **_Data Scientist_** and passionate about **_ML & AI_**.

Currently, I'm pursuing graduation at  **`University of Washington, USA`**  and  **`Tsinghua University, China`**.  <strong style="color:#2E6930">I'm actively looking for a job/internship in Data Science or Machine Learning</strong>. If you see my skillset match for a job, please give me a shout at <chakalasiyajay00@gmail.com>.

I maintain this blog to share my thoughts and learnings. Apart from sharing this also helps me to take a step back and see how far I have come?
